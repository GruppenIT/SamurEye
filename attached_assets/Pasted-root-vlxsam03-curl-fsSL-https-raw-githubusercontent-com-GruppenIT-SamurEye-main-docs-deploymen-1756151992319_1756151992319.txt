Pending kernel upgrade!
Running kernel version:
  6.8.0-41-generic
Diagnostics:
  The currently running kernel version is not the expected kernel version 6.8.0-78-generic.

Restarting the system to load the new kernel will not be handled automatically, so you should consider rebooting.

Restarting services...

Service restarts being deferred:
