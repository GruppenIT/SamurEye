# SamurEye MVP - Breach & Attack Simulation Platform

## Overview

SamurEye is a comprehensive Breach & Attack Simulation (BAS) platform designed for small to medium enterprises (SMEs) in Brazil. The platform provides attack surface validation, threat intelligence, and security testing capabilities through a cloud-based frontend and edge collectors. This MVP focuses on internal testing environments and orchestrates security testing journeys using tools like Nmap and Nuclei.

The system enables security teams to discover vulnerabilities, test EDR/AV solutions, monitor Active Directory hygiene, and validate their organization's security posture through automated testing scenarios.
